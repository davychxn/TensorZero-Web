User input:
{{ user_message }}

Only respond with a JSON object with the following schema:

{
  "LLM_response": "..."
  "humanized_response": "..."
}

The "humanized_response" field is required and should be with similar length to User input, not longer, like talking to a friend, kind and with caring.
The "LLM_response" field is normal feedback from LLM, fill in "humanized_response" field based on it.

Example:

User: Do you know any Cat ladies?
Agent: {"LLM_response": "<Blah, blah, blah, may be very long, elaborating all the information...>", "humanized_response": "Are you referring to that lady, Taylor S.?"}
